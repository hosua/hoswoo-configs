Below are some reminders for my future self
```
Put .xinitrc in ~/
Put vifm in ~/.config/
Put scripts in ~/Desktop/Scripts/
```
Necessary packages:
```
sudo pacman -S base-devel xorg xcompgr
```
Quick download for some optional packages used that I can think of right now:
```
sudo pacman -S chromium firefox alsa-utils scrot vifm feh vim neovim neofetch 
```
